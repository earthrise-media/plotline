Title,Pakistan Floods of 2022,Stock video of pakistan floods,,
1,"Pakistan is at the center of a global climate crisis. A series of meteorological disasters in 2022 included glacial outbursts in the Upper Indus Basin, urban flooding in Karachi and Hyderabad, torrential rains and runoffs in Balochistan, flash floods in southern Punjab, and unprecedented rains in central Sindh.",stock photo? or timelapse of satellite imagery,Copied from Lancelet,https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2822%2901874-8
2,"the flooding was unprecedented and has had a devastating impact on the people, infrastructure, and agriculture of Pakistan",,,
3,Our team analyzed data derived from satellite imagery by Vienna University of Technology to explore the extent of this flooding and better understand the potential impact of this unprecedented flooding.,,,
4,To put this flooding in context we need to better understand the geography of Pakistan as a country.,,,
5,"Pakistan is the world's fifth most populous country with a population of ~243 million people. This map illustrates Pakistan's population by height; the taller the bar, the more people that live in a location.",,,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population
https://www.worldpop.org/"
6,"Pakistan's most populous cities are, Karachi in the South with a population of  ~15 million...  ",karachi pop zoom in. maybe color just karachi population if it's not too hard,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_Pakistan_by_population
7,and Lahore in the North with a population of ~11 million.,Lahore pop zoom in. maybe color just Lahore population if it's not too hard. would need to join grid to regional/city boundaries.,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_Pakistan_by_population
8,Together these cities account 10% of Pakistan's total population of ~243 million people.,Overall population summary.,,
9,"From a geography perspective, Pakistan is a blend of landscapes. ",,,
10,There are the northern highlands of the Himalayas with some of the world's tallest mountains like K2. ,K2 zoom in with 3d maps,,
11,There is the Balochistan region in the southwest,vector of region,,
12,"And of course, the Indus river basin with a catchment area of almost 1 million square kilometers. This is the location of the ancient Indus Valley Civilization a cradle of ancient humanity that has been populated for more than 5,000 years.",maybe get a vector of the catchment area?,,
13,"Because of pakistan's geography it's susceptible to natural disasters exacerbated by climate change; particularly, it's very susceptible to devastating floods. ",,,
14,Flooding is of highest risk in the Indus River Basin due to the runoff from the Himalayas and unique topography of this basin. ,,need source,
15,"This summer, on the heels of an above average rainy spring, there was a deluge lasting almost a month, drenching the southwest in unprecedented rain. ",,,
16,"Scroll down the page to see an illustration of flooding spread across the region over a four week period. Note, monitoring of flooded areas started after much of the region had already received a large amount of precipitation.",,,
17,August 18,flood 1,maybe make these chapters shorter scroll length?,

32,"The flooding also coincided with many highly populated areas. The colors of these bars represent the population in flooded areas. The darker red, the more people that live in that location.",,,
33,It's estimated that these floods impacted more than 33 million people. Over 1500 were confirmed dead with more 1/3 of those children.,,,
34,"The true impact of such a disaster is hard to fathom, but let's look at how flooding may have impacted Pakistan's agriculture. To better understand their food security.",zoom out of flooding and population,,
35,"This map shows where farming happens in Pakistan. The bigger the circle, the more of that area that is dedicated to cropland. ",Dot map of agriculture.,,
36,Note the heavy concentration in the Indus river basin.,different view of dot map of agriculture,,
37,"Now compare to where there was major flooding. The deeper red of the circle, the more flooding in that area.",color circles by flood extent,,
38,Experts estimate _________ impact on agriculture. ,,,

44,"a sobering reality is that this type of flooding is going to happen more, and more often, due to climate change. ",stock photo,,
45,Experts predict that extreme flood events induced by climate change are ______% more likely to happen over the next_____ years.,stock photo,,
46,one more stat on climate impact,stock photo,,
47,"As the acute impact of the flooding subsides, food security remains tenuous and agriculture infrastructure is slow to rebound. ",stock photo,,
