# Data Exploration

### The Exploration
This folder is a central repository for our data exploration endevours. Data exploration is usually a first step in our initiatives and allow us to understand better the types of insights we may want to explore. Most of the exploration itself is done in Jupyter notebooks in this folder, we do our best to explain what we're learning in these notebooks and make our learnings accessible. 

Sometimes it makes more sense to work with data using javascript. In these cases we typically work with Observable. You can check out our [Observable profile here](https://observablehq.com/@earthrise?tab=profile) to check out this work. 

#### The Data
As for the actual data. Some of the data we use is accessed through the APIs, in which case we include resources in our notebooks explaining how we access the data. We keep the smaller files here in the [data folder](https://github.com/earthrise-media/plotline/tree/main/data-exploration/data), but we store the bigger files on AWS. If you're interested in checking out these files and/or downloading them for yourself, check out our [AWS data explorer here](https://plotline.streamlit.app/AWS_Data).
