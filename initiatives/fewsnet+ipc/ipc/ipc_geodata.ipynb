Additionally, LCS shows phase 4 situation with 31.6% in phase 4 and 30.4% in phase 3. The PLSA data shows that 64% of households experienced at least some type of shock in the last 6 months in urban Balkh: Loss of employment: 58%; reduced income: 14%; Severe sickness or natural death of breadwinner (non-COVID): 9%: sickness/death due to COVID-19: 10%. Income for the majority of the households reduced significantly: PLSA data shows that income decreased slightly for 24% of households and decreased significantly for 74% of households. Income did not change only for 3% of households. The reduction of income is reflected in the debt data as well. IOM data show that households' debt level increased to $400. As per the PLSA data, main income sources are non-agriculture wage labor: 21%; Skilled labor: 32%; Salary work: 13%: Remittances: 2%; Transport: 4%. food access is a major challenge because food commodity prices increased significantly.

The assistance received fulfills 75% of the household's calorie needs. The percentage of households in Phases 4 and 3 decreases by around 10% after factoring in the impact of HFA in the analysis.

HDDS shows IPC phase 3 situation with 18.8% in phase 4 and 49.2% in IPC phase 3. HHS is indicative of phase 4 with 22% of people in this phase and 49.2% in phase 3. Additionally, LCS shows phase 4 situation with 31.6% in phase 4 and 30.4% in phase 3. The PLSA data shows that 64% of households experienced at least some type of shock in the last 6 months in urban Balkh: Loss of employment: 58%; reduced income: 14%; Severe sickness or natural death of breadwinner (non-COVID): 9%: sickness/death due to COVID-19: 10%. Income for the majority of the households reduced significantly: PLSA data shows that income decreased slightly for 24% of households and decreased significantly for 74% of households. Income did not change only for 3% of households. The reduction of income is reflected in the debt data as well. IOM data show that households' debt level increased to $400. As per the PLSA data, main income sources are non-agriculture wage labor: 21%; Skilled labor: 32%; Salary work: 13%: Remittances: 2%; Transport: 4%. food access is a major challenge because food commodity prices increased significantly. Although food production had been affected by last year's drought and will be affected by the La Nina this year.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the current period, 46% of rural Balkh assisted with food assistance. The assistance received fulfills 75% of the household's calorie needs. The percentage of households in Phases 4 and 3 decreases by around 10% after factoring in the impact of HFA in the analysis. HFA not just decreases the % of people in IPC phase 4 and 3 but also decreases the severity of food insecurity to some degree and that's why there is a move of around 5% people from IPC phase 4 to 3.\", 'prolonged_crisis': True, 'population_phase_worse': None, 'population_percentage_phase_worse': None, 'anl_id': '25114450', 'admin_type': 'urb', 'title': 'Balkh Urban', 'color': '#E67800', 'estimated_population': '650163', 'phase1_population': 65016, 'phase1_percent': 0.1, 'phase1_color': '#CDFACD', 'phase2_population': 260065, 'phase2_percent': 0.4, 'phase2_color': '#FAE61E', 'phase3_population': 227557.0, 'phase3_percent': 0.35, 'phase3_color': '#E67800', 'phase4_population': 97524.0, 'phase4_percent': 0.15, 'phase4_color': '#C80000', 'phase5_population': 0.0, 'phase5_percent': 0.0, 'phase5_color': '#640000'}, 'geometry': {'type': 'Point', 'coordinates': (67.113945007, 36.711146579)}}"

Le niveau de stock alimentaire a baiss\\u00e9 tant  au niveau des march\\u00e9s qu\\u2019au niveau des m\\u00e9nages entrainant ainsi une r\\u00e9duction de nombre des repas \\u00e0 l\\u2019ordre de 1.3 contre 3 habituellement observ\\u00e9 dans la r\\u00e9gion. Faible score de consommation : pauvre 15%, limite 32% et acceptable 53% .  36% de la population ont  adopt\\u00e9 des strat\\u00e9gies d\\u0027adaptation. Cela est due a l\\u0027augmentation du nombre de d\\u00e9plac\\u00e9es, une cons\\u00e9quence de la persistance des conflits arm\\u00e9s dans la zone.

About 4.1% are stress coping while 2.5% are in crisis coping, 4.9% borrowed money and 3% used savings and about 20% lost employment through reduced employment and death of breadwinner thus reflecting phase 2. While nutrition and mortality indicators point to Phase 1, because GAM and SAM was collected around March when there was food assistance in the region. Not only that, a malnutrition programme exist for malnourished children. However,considering the fact that the lower part (LCM and DMV) of the Manzini region have been receiving assistance from NDMA and WFP which ended in April and the situation needs close monitoring. Survival deficit stands at 8% and total 10% and thus reflecting phase 2. \\r\\n\\r\\nBased on the indicative phase classifications, the outcomes and contributing factors point to Phase 2 Overall

La d\\u00e9capitalisation est tr\\u00e8s faible et il faut noter que la plupart des actifs se sont \\u00e9puis\\u00e9s durant les ann\\u00e9es pr\\u00e9c\\u00e9dentes de s\\u00e9cheresse.

households in phase 1 meaning they are experiencing no survival and livelihood protection deficits.  Only 2% of very poor households in the mountains had survival deficit of 34%, while those in the foothills has deficit of 3%. Cereal production estimates are higher than 10 year average and therefore there is enough food available in the district. Prices of staple food presented a declining trend and the purchasing power seemed to be stable. The prevalence of wasting is estimated at 1% which has remained stable over years. Based on HEA and the contributing factors, the current period is estimated to be in Phase 1.&quot;, &quot;link&quot;: &quot;http://www.ipcinfo.org/ipc-country-analysis/details-map/en/c/1118553/&quot;,

&quot;ipc_period&quot;: &quot;C&quot;, &quot;justification&quot;: &quot;The direct evidence (food consumption score) on food consumption outcomes suggests a Phase 3 for this district, however, other indirect food consumption indicators suggest a Phase 2. Contributing factors on the other hand all see to point to conditions that are better than Phase 2. This is also supported by the indicative phases from Livelihood Change, nutrition outcomes as well as mortality outcomes.  Contributing factors, especially on availability and access are more indicative of a lower phase, given the very good cereal harvest, good rainfall performance, and falling food prices. \\r\\nBy converging all this evidence, the conclusion is that the district is classified in Phase 2.&quot;, &quot;link&quot;: &quot;http://www.ipcinfo.org/ipc-country-analysis/details-map/en/c/1118553/&quot;,

respectively. Food prices are somewhat declining compared to their previous year prices but still higher than the 5 year average. The majority of households have not adopted any coping strategies, while a very small proportion of the total population have adopted stress coping strategies indicating that households still have food stocks from own production and are able to purchase from markets to meet household staple food needs. There is still a high proportion of households with poor food consumption, due limited access to other nutritious food items and cultural food patterns in the region which are largely monotonous. Education interventions that will inform on the importance of diversified diets will be beneficial, however  action is required for disaster risk reduction and the protection of livelihoods.&quot;,

Taking into consideration the very poor, the survival and livelihood protection deficit scored 9% and 1% respectively. The total amounts to 10% giving a total population 12,241 that in need of humanitarian assistance. But with the more evidence added namely FCS, Livelihood Coping strategy, HEA and FIES coupled with the indirect evidence of rCSI and number of meals per day. More survival deficit on the very poor is at the highest peak during Sep-Oct with more than 65%, but the need of assistance to the very poor is required as the very poor is already facing the deficit though it is minor. However, the poor population only face the survival deficit during Jan-Feb meaning the shift of the poor to very poor.&quot;, &quot;link&quot;:
