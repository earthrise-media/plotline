# Stories
The stories folder houses our content for finished stories hosted on our external site. These folders should contain public assets that we use for these stories. Each story should have the story, and assets folder linked in the main page readme. Furthermore, each storyâ€™s readme should give an overview of the work that went in to the story and link to any external repositories used during development.
